A Beginner’s Guide for Absolute Beginners

What is Git?
Git is a free, open-source version control software. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.

This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides.

Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So they need a version control system like Git to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.

Also, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of their code.

The branch system in Git allows developers to work individually on a task (For example: One branch -> One task OR One branch -> One developer). Basically think of Git as a small software application that controls your code base, if you’re a developer.
